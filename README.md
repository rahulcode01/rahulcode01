## Hey there! 👋

I'm **Rahul Singh**, a passionate **Full-Stack Web Developer**.

I enjoy building clean, responsive, and user-friendly web applications.  
When I get an idea, I like to turn it into a real project and improve it step by step.

My main tech stack includes **JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB**, and **Tailwind CSS**.  
I love working on both frontend and backend and learning new technologies every day.

I have built several practice and personal projects.
